# Usage

Unraid template available on [superboki's Repository](https://github.com/superboki/UNRAID-FR/tree/main/stable-diffusion-advanced) (search stable-diffusion in community apps)

## Choosing a Project

Use the environmental variable `WEBUI_VERSION` to choose which [project](#projects) to install and use based on the number in the **WEBUI** column. [easy diffusion](https://github.com/easydiffusion/easydiffusion) (`01`) is installed if none is specified. 

Example: To use SD.Next => `WEBUI_VERSION=04`

```
docker run ... -e WEBUI_VERSION=04 ... holaflenain/stable-diffusion
```

or modify `WEBUI_VERSION` in [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml)

## Docker Notes

### Using PUID and PGID

If you are 

* running on a **linux host** (ie unraid) and
* **not** using [rootless containers with Podman](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/09/25/rootless-containers-with-podman-the-basics#why_podman_)

then you must set the [environmental variables **PUID** and **PGID**.](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/understanding-puid-and-pgid) in the container in order for it to generate files/folders your normal user can interact it.

Run these commands from your terminal

* `id -u` -- prints UID for **PUID**
* `id -g` -- prints GID for **PGID**

Then add to your docker command like so:

```shell
docker run -d ... -e "PUID=1000" -e "PGID=1000" ... holaflenain/stable-diffusion
```

or substitute them in [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml)

### Docker Compose
  
Reference [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) which uses Easy-Diffusion as an example.

## Directory Structure

Each interface has its own folder :  
- **stable-diffusion** folder tree:  
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-easy-diffusion  
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-sd-webui  
...  
â”œâ”€â”€ 51-facefusion   
â”œâ”€â”€ 70-kohya   
â””â”€â”€ models  

Models, VAEs, and other files are located in the shared models directory and symlinked for each user interface, excluding InvokeAI:    
- **Models** folder tree :  
â”œâ”€â”€ embeddings  
â”œâ”€â”€ hypernetwork  
â”œâ”€â”€ lora  
â”œâ”€â”€ stable-diffusion  
â”œâ”€â”€ upscale  
â””â”€â”€ vae  
  
By default, each user interface will save data in its own directory, which is automatically created during the initial installation of the UI. To modify the storage path, you can edit the 'parameters.txt' file for InvokeAI and ComfyUI, while for the others, it can be adjusted via the WebUI.  
- **Outputs** folder tree :  
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-Easy-Diffusion  
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-sd-webui  
...   
â”œâ”€â”€ 20-kubin   
â”œâ”€â”€ 50-lama-cleaner   
â””â”€â”€ 51-facefusion   

## Project Notes

Some projects have modified install/startup changes to address performance or suggested fixes. 

General changes are listed below and **specified in notes if they apply.** Specific project modifications are listed below these.

###### Clean Environment

When the container starts if the installed project is outdated compared to the _upstream project_ then the latest code is pulled and dependencies for installation are wiped and re-installed. Subsequent container starts will be much faster since the project will not be re-installed. This behavior can be **forced** by setting the docker environmental variable `CLEAN_ENV=true`.


#### Stable Diffusion WebUI (02) Notes

* Uses [Clean Environment](#clean-environment) performance improvement

#### SD.Next (04) Notes

* Uses [Clean Environment](#clean-environment) performance improvement
* Uses an updated `malloc` library to fix a [memory leak](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/discussions/6722)
  * This can be turned off by adding the docker environmental variable `NO_TCMALLOC=true`

Support for the WebUIs available on their respective pages.

## Troubleshooting

First thing to try when a UI refuse to launch, remove the cache and the numbered folder (ex :02-sd-webui ) then relaunch the container
